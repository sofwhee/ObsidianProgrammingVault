```javascript
const today = new Date();
const birthday = new Date("December 17, 1995 03:24:00"); // DISCOURAGED: may not work in all runtimes
const birthday2 = new Date("1995-12-17T03:24:00"); // This is standardized and will work reliably
const birthday3 = new Date(1995, 11, 17); // the month is 0-indexed
const birthday4 = new Date(1995, 11, 17, 3, 24, 0);
const birthday5 = new Date(628021800000); // passing epoch timestamp
```
